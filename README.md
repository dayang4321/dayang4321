#### A Software Developer (Front End)

I'm a software developer specializing in front-end technologies, with over 4 years of experience in web and mobile application development. Recently, I completed my Masterâ€™s in Computer Science, focusing on advanced software development. My journey began with a background in mechanical engineering, bringing a unique perspective to problem-solving in the world of software engineering.

ðŸ›  **Primary Tools:** âš›  TypeScript, React, ðŸ“± React Native, ðŸ’» HTML/CSS,

- ðŸ”­ **Academic Experience:** During my time as a Computer Science Masterâ€™s student at TU Dublin, I delved into various aspects of software development, honing my skills and expanding my knowledge base. I engaged in coursework covering topics such as Web and User Interface Design, Systems Analysis and Testing, Programming Paradigms, and Machine Learning. Noteworthy projects include simulating a stack-smashing attack and implementing the SHA3/Keccak algorithm in C, designing an ML experiment comparing k-fold cross-validation vs hold-out testing, and leading an MSc. thesis team project [Accessibilator](https://redpenny.app/)
